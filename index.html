            <p><span style="font-size: 40px;">Hi!</span> and welcome to my hobby page, as you have
                probably
                guessed, the top of this page <br>
                is the guitar. It has been a hobby of mine for over 15 years. The reason I love the guitar <br>
                as a hobby is the fact that the learning journey is never complete, much like programming. <br>
                Click <a href="#why">HERE</a> if you would like to see more reasons why it is my favourite hobby!</p>
